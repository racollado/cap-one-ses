Capital One SES - Skyscanner Web App

With so many travel options available today, planning a trip can become overwhelming. There is a large volume of competing travel websites all claiming to offer the cheapest rates out there. We would like you to build a web app using Skyscanner API that helps travelers find the cheapest flight for their travel needs. You decide how the information will be displayed - be creative! 

Deliverables: 
Let users view their flight options between two destinations for specific dates
Allow users to select their currency preference when searching for flights
Use intuitive UI principles to highlight or call out the cheapest flights for a user running a search
